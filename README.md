## **Etigei Exilium**

Succesor to the defunct and incomplete v6 Etigeox mod. After four years of intermittent development, the latest iteration of the Etigeox mod has finally released! Etigei Exile offers a fresh and uniquely creative modded experience, featuring two planets and campaigns through 18 sectors. 

Establish colonies on the frozen planet of Neoulandia and experience destructible trees, limited resources, excessive use of unit cargo, and unique map design. Neoulandia brings economy-based map to offer diverging gameplay on top of the classical survival and attack maps. 

Rubiginosus presents a collection of hardcore maps, inspired by Rusted Warfare, initially designed for multiplayer using Serpulo and Erekir technology. These missions have been retrofitted for a campaign experience with unique challenges for each map.

## **FAQ**

### **What’s the story behind four years of development?**  
The Etigeox mod began in 2021 as a project to expand Mindustry with content inspired by the Etigeox Universe. Initially, it focused on a higher-tier of blocks for Serpulo. Over time, the Rubiginosus maps — initially standalone multiplayer experiences — were incorporated into the main mod. Since its inception, the mod has undergone four rewrites to reach its current form. We are not doing a fifth rewrite.

### **What is the Etigeox Universe?**  
The Etigeox Universe is a collaborative creative writing project by mod authors Mitemi and Superwibr. Though, no content has officially been published, extensive worldbuilding and a short novel have been completed. Message the developers on the Discord for more information.

### **What’s next?**  
Future updates will continue to build on gameplay depth, with new units, maps, and lore-rich mechanics planned for upcoming phases. See the roadmap above.

### **The sprites aren’t great!**  
We aren't great at spriting.

##Planets
planet.etigeox-Neoulandia.name = Neoulandia
planet.etigeox-Rubiginosus.name = Rubiginosus

##Rusted
sector.etigeox-miss1.name = Dividing Titanium
sector.etigeox-miss1.description = The United Earth and the League of Independant States are fighting for control of the titanium within this area. It is your time to take command. Defend our newly established colony and take over their titanium mines to the East. A mercenary force was also hired to hinder our progress.\n\n[Mod Author notes: This planet is a rather difficult campaign based on the Rusted Warfare missions. Serpulo and Erekir tech is used here.]
sector.etigeox-miss2.name = Ice Raid
sector.etigeox-miss2.description = After obtaining titanium, we must take down the League's fortresses in the north. Break the stalemate and end their time in the frozen icey mountains.
sector.etigeox-miss3.name = Cross Assault
sector.etigeox-miss3.description = This island is split between our forces, the League and Independant mercenaries. Which one shall we take down first?\n\n[Mod Author notes: This is quite probably the worst map of the campaign. It is recommended to skip it straight to mission 4, which is unlocked. The maps do get better after this.]
sector.etigeox-miss4.name = Sneeky Breeky
sector.etigeox-miss4.description = The League is very well entrenched from one side, however a secret lab and an unexploited piece of land aren't under their control. Strike from where is unexpected and be in control.
sector.etigeox-miss5.name = Desert Reboot
sector.etigeox-miss5.description = When the hope of new beginnings burned our eyes. The League has established their fortress in the desert and is slowly colonising the region. Capture the sector in the name of the United Earth.
sector.etigeox-miss6.name = Snowy Domain
sector.etigeox-miss6.description = Fall Blau.
sector.etigeox-miss7.name = Lava Order
sector.etigeox-miss7.description = The League is in posession of a precious transit hub located inside of a volcano. This proves extremely valuable for power generation and for logistics. Unfortunately and ironically, very few resources are found inside. Therefore, we have authorised the use of material receivers shipping directly from nearby colonial holdings. Protect them at all cost.
sector.etigeox-miss8.name = Rivertide
sector.etigeox-miss8.description = Go forth downstream.
